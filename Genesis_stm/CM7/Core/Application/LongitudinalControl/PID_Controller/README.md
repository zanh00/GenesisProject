PID Controller
===================================

Platform Independent

This library was modeled off of Brett Beauregard's implementation of a PID controller (with all of the real-world testing and theoretical concepts applied). This is a robust algorithm and has been adapted and slightly improved for use on any microcontroller required.

This C coded library can be used in any application requiring a PID controller. No matter the platform
(Arduino/AVR, PIC, MSP430, Kinetis, STM32, etc...), this library can be applied with absolutely no
changing of the underlying implementation of the code. Include this library in any C/C++ project as
needed.

All documentation for how to use the library can be found in the header file of the library.
